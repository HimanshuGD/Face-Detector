# Face_Recognizer
Face Recognizer is smart web application which will detect the face in given image url by clarifai Api...

With React, Node.js, Clarifai API, and PostgreSQL, I built a web application that revolutionizes the way you browse and view photos. Using the power of Clarifai API, my application allows you to easily identify and locate faces in your photo albums. With the intuitive React front-end and Node.js server, along with efficient data storage in PostgreSQL, this application provides a smooth and seamless browsing experience. As an added bonus, I used nodemon and Postman API to ensure reliable server performance. Whether you're an amateur photographer or a professional, this application is the perfect solution for anyone looking to organize their photos with ease.
